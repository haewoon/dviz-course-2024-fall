# Project deliverables

## Proposal slides

You will present your project proposal in **7 minutes** and submit the slides including the below information: 

- Project title
- Team members
- Introduction
    - Motivation: Why your project is important? Why should we care? Provide convincing motivation by connecting your projects to real-world problems, societal impact, or innovative applications of visualization techniques.
    - Background: Review and discuss relevant existing visualizations. What is a gap between existing work and your ideas? 
- Questions or goals: What kinds of visualizations do you want to create? What questions do you want to answer through visualizations? 
- Datasets and methods: 
    - Candidate datasets: Introduce your datasets that are the most relevant to your goals. What does it look like? If it is a tabular dataset what kinds of columns (data types) are there? If it's more like a free-form data, how will you preprocess?
    - Prelminary exploration: What are the characteristics of the data? 
    - Visualization plan: What kinds of visualization methods do you plan to apply to achieve your goal? Why? 
    - Sketch: Show some sketches of your final visualization.

## Final presentation slides

Record a **12-minute** video (please respect the time!) and upload it to YouTube (you can either publish it or make it *unlisted*). The last page of your slide should display the URL of your YouTube video. Submit your slides on Canvas. Pack your presentation with compelling visualizations, but also make it interesting and fun!! Check the rubric on Canvas.


## Final report

Submit your code and a report on your work. Ideally, your code will be in well-documented Jupyter notebooks (e.g., see Peter Norvig's notebooks or good Kaggle exploratory data visualization kernels).

The report has no minimum or maximum length requirement. Check the rubric on Canvas for the contents you should include in the report.
