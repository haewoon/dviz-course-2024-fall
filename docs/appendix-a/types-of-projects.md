# Types of projects

Below are some major project types (but not limited to):

- Data analysis
- Revelatory data visualization
- Explanatory visualization

## Data analysis
A very nice way to do this type of project is to pick one [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) dataset or competition and create an exploratory data visualization kernel (a Jupyter notebook that analyzes and visualizes your data).

### Examples
Here are some examples of data analysis projects. Most of them are pretty extensive but you can get an idea of what data analysis includes.

- [An example machine learning notebook](https://github.com/rhiever/Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/example-data-science-notebook/Example%20Machine%20Learning%20Notebook.ipynb)
- [Map of Reddit](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-reddit/?x=18239&y=12514&z=69732.14453558448&v=2)
- [Kaggle Competition | Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster](https://nbviewer.org/github/agconti/kaggle-titanic/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb)
- [SF drug geography](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/lmart999/GIS/blob/master/SF_GIS_Crime.ipynb)
- [Getting started with GDELT](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dmasad/GDELT_Intro/blob/master/Getting_Started_with_GDELT.ipynb)
- [538 Election Forecasting Model](https://github.com/jseabold/538model)
- [An exploratory statistical analysis of the 2014 World Cup Final](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rjtavares/football-crunching/blob/master/notebooks/an%20exploratory%20data%20analysis%20of%20the%20world%20cup%20final.ipynb)
- [Sun activity](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jhemann/4569783)
- [Face Recognition on a subset of the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ogrisel/notebooks/blob/master/Labeled%20Faces%20in%20the%20Wild%20recognition.ipynb)
- [Apache log analysis with Pandas](Apache log analysis with Pandas)


## Revelatory data visualization
The idea is to visualize data as clearly as possible to deliver a key message. Sometimes the data is straightforward, but even just visualizing it effectively can be an amazing visualization project.

### Examples

**Society, health, and economy**

- [Racial dot map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=30d2e10d4d694b3eb4dc4d2e58dbb5a5)
- [Our world in data: Financing healthcare](https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare/)
- [How the Recession Reshaped the Economy, in 255 Charts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html)
- [You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children’s College Chances](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html)
- [Shipmap](https://www.shipmap.org/)
- [Mapping Migration in the United States](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/upshot/mapping-migration-in-the-united-states-since-1900.html)

**Politics**

- [Who Is Favored To Win The 2024 Presidential Election?](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/)
- [How Birth Year Influences Political Views](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/08/upshot/how-the-year-you-were-born-influences-your-politics.html)

**Sports**

- [Spellsy's Kill Charts - Heatmap analysis of all teams at Worlds](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spellsy-s-kill-charts-heatmap-analysis-of-all-team/1100-6438517/)


## Explanatory visualization

Visualization and animation can unravel complex scientific concepts, intricate processes, or abstract ideas, and people have been trying to tap into this power to make information more accessible and understandable.

### Examples

A good example would be [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)'s amazing mathematics videos.

- [A visual introduction to machine learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
- [Visualizing Algorithms](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/)
- [Attacking discrimination with smarter machine learning](https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/)
- [Watch how the measles outbreak spreads when kids get vaccinated – and when they don't](https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/feb/05/-sp-watch-how-measles-outbreak-spreads-when-kids-get-vaccinated)
