# Course overview

## Course description 

Data visualization plays a pivotal role in understanding information, from news
articles to cutting-edge scientific research, and is employed across diverse
settings, from home offices to the world's largest corporations. As an integral
component of data analysis, data visualization has become a crucial skill for
all knowledge workers.

This introductory course delves into the core concepts of statistical data
analysis and visualization. You will explore the foundations of data
visualization, covering topics such as perception, integrity, design principles,
statistical methods, data classifications, and various visualization techniques.
Through hands-on exercises utilizing the Python stack, students will develop
practical skills in data processing and visualization.


## Course objectives

Upon completing the course, you are expected to acquire the ability to produce
data visualizations that are effective, accurate, and ethical.  You will also
be able to critically evaluate data visualizations and effectively communicate
your findings to others.  This ability will build on your understanding of the
fundamental principles of data visualization, including human perception,
design, data types, and visualization techniques.  Your proficiency will be
showcased through a course project through which you will not only create data
visualizations but also document the process of creating effective, accurate,
and ethical data visualizations.

## Relationships with IVMOOC

This course differs from E583/Z637 in that it places greater emphasis on
fundamental statistical visualizations and conducting exploratory data analysis
through coding, utilizing the Python data science and visualization stack. As a
result, it may be a more suitable choice for students aiming for careers in
research, development, engineering, and data analysis, or for those who will
directly handle and analyze complex datasets.
