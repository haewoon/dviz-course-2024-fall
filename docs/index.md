- **Instructor**: [Haewoon Kwak](http://soda-labo.github.io) (Office Hours: Wednesday 9:30-10:30) 
- **TAs**: 
    - Andrea Chung (Office hours: Mon 10-11am & Fri 9-10am)
    - Radhika Agarwal (Office hours: Wed 3-4pm & Fri 3-4pm)
    - Jeet Patel (Mon 6-7pm & Thu 10-11am)
- **Announcements**: All announcements will be sent via Canvas. 
- **Prerequisites**: This course is open to graduate students (I590). Because programming (Mainly in Python) is an integral part of the course, it is required to have good understanding and working knowledge of programming. The basic programming courses (Both I210/I211 or equivalent) are required prerequisites. In addition, *I308: Information Representation* and a basic statistics course is a recommended prerequisite. Basic understanding of design process and web (HTML, CSS, Javascript) is also highly recommended.
- **Syllabus**: You can download the syllabus via Canvas. 

## Course description 

Data visualization plays a pivotal role in understanding information, from news
articles to cutting-edge scientific research, and is employed across diverse
settings, from home offices to the world's largest corporations. As an integral
component of data analysis, data visualization has become a crucial skill for
all knowledge workers.

This introductory course delves into the core concepts of statistical data
analysis and visualization. You will explore the foundations of data
visualization, covering topics such as perception, integrity, design principles,
statistical methods, data classifications, and various visualization techniques.
Through hands-on exercises utilizing the Python stack, students will develop
practical skills in data processing and visualization.


## Course objectives

Upon completing the course, you are expected to acquire the ability to produce
data visualizations that are effective, accurate, and ethical.  You will also
be able to critically evaluate data visualizations and effectively communicate
your findings to others.  This ability will build on your understanding of the
fundamental principles of data visualization, including human perception,
design, data types, and visualization techniques.  Your proficiency will be
showcased through a course project through which you will not only create data
visualizations but also document the process of creating effective, accurate,
and ethical data visualizations.


## Prerequisites

Because producing visualizations using Python data & visualization stack is an integral part of the course, it is required to have a good understanding and working knowledge of programming (esp. Python), as well as working knowledge of using open-source libraries. It is also recommended to have a basic understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the Web (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JSON).

For self-assessment, visit the following [link](https://github.com/haewoon/dviz-course-2024-fall/blob/master/syllabus/self-assessment.ipynb). Contact the instructor if you are uncertain about your background.


## Expectation and Requirements

The primary assessment will be through the assignments, the exam, and the team project. The topic of the team project will be of your team’s choice, but I'd encourage everyone to consult with the instructors. You are required to submit a final report that contains not only the results but also a detailed explanation of the visualization process to demonstrate your knowledge of visualization principles and techniques, as well as your ability to apply them to create visualizations. You are expected to complete all course modules (quizzes and discussions) and assignments, as well as visualization critiques through the “Visualization of the Week (VotW).” You are also expected to engage in discussion on Canvas.

## Books and Key Materials

There is no required textbook, but we will mainly use materials from the following books:

Fundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus O. Wilke (available online at [https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html))
The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (2nd ed.) by E.R. Tufte: One of the foundational books on visualization. It contains a rich set of historical visualization and thoughtful discussion on visualization principles.

If you are in the process of learning the basics of Python, the following books and websites may be helpful for you:

- [https://docs.python.org/3/](https://docs.python.org/3/) : Python 3 Official Documentation
- [http://www.diveintopython3.net/index.html](http://www.diveintopython3.net/index.html) : Dive Into Python by Mark Pilgrim
- [http://www.learnpython.org](http://www.learnpython.org) : A web-based interactive tutorial 
- [http://ipython.rossant.net](http://ipython.rossant.net) : Learning IPython for Interactive Computing and Data Visualization by Cyrille Rossant: Introduction to IPython as well as lots of advanced analysis
- If you are interested in web-based visualizations, you should check out the ObservableHQ and its tutorials for D3.js, Vega-Lite, and Observable Plot, all available at the following URL: [https://observablehq.com/tutorials](https://observablehq.com/tutorials). 


## Relationships with IVMOOC

This course differs from E583/Z637 in that it places greater emphasis on
fundamental statistical visualizations and conducting exploratory data analysis
through coding, utilizing the Python data science and visualization stack. As a
result, it may be a more suitable choice for students aiming for careers in
research, development, engineering, and data analysis, or for those who will
directly handle and analyze complex datasets.

## Special Thanks

- [Prof. YY Ahn](https://yongyeol.com) designed this course and kindly provided all the materials for the foundation.
